# StanfordIntroToMachineLearning
My repo to track my progress for Coursera's Intro to Machine Learning course, taught by Stanford professor Andrew Ng.


Coursera Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Lecture Notes from Stanford's class: http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

Also found http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.htmlto be very helpful, especially the lecture notes.
